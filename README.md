# CSharp-Game
console app

This is a repo for fundementals of the c# language. This repo also has a basic console game that shows how to add classes and use them to inherrit off of one another. 

I have learned with the repo:

1. Structs and how to use them

2. Consutructors and how they work with your code

3. List and how they store data within them

4. There are also some challenges given by instructors to dive deeper into the language.

5. The simple console app shows how seperate code and use classes to help your code rather than just make using one file for everything. Clean code is essential.
